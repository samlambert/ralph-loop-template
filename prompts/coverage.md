Goal: improve test coverage.

Process:
1. Generate or update a coverage report (coverage-report.txt if you create one).
2. Identify the most critical uncovered paths.
3. Add tests for ONE uncovered path.
4. Re-run coverage to verify improvement.
5. Append a short entry to progress.txt and commit.

Target: 80% coverage minimum (or project-specific target).
If coverage target is met, output <ralph>COMPLETE</ralph>.
Otherwise, output <ralph>CONTINUE</ralph>.
